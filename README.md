#Credit Card Fraud Detection using Sampling Techniques and Machine Learning
#Overview

This project analyzes the impact of different sampling techniques on various machine learning classification models for credit card fraud detection.
Since fraud datasets are highly imbalanced, Random Oversampling is used to balance the data before applying sampling and model training.

The performance of each model is evaluated using accuracy, and the best sampling technique for each model is identified.
